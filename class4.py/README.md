## Introduction

A **list** is a built-in data structure in Python that is mutable, or changeable, and allows you to store an ordered collection of items, which can be of any type. Lists are one of the most versatile data types in Python and are widely used to handle data and perform various operations.

## What is a List?

A list in Python is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets `[]`, where each item is separated by a comma. Lists can contain items of different types, including other lists.

```python
# Examples of lists
empty_list = []
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
