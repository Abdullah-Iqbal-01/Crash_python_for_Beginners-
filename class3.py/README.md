## Introduction

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python provides several types of operators to perform various tasks such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations:

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division (float result)
- `//` : Floor Division (integer result)
- `%` : Modulus (remainder of division)
- `**` : Exponentiation (power)

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # Addition: 13
print(a - b)   # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)   # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)   # Division: 3.3333...
print(a // b)  # Floor Division: 3
print(a % b)   # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b)  # Exponentiation: 1000
