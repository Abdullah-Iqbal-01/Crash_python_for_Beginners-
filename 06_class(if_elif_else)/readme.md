## Introduction

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute code based on specific conditions. Python provides three main constructs for this:

- `if` – to test a condition.
- `elif` – stands for "else if", which allows for multiple conditions.
- `else` – executes if none of the preceding conditions are true.

## Basic Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if another_condition is true
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are false
