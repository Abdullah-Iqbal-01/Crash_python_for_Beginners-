## Introduction

Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in Python. They are sequences of characters used to represent text. Python provides a variety of ways to manipulate strings and a powerful formatting tool known as **f-strings** to make string interpolation easy and intuitive.

## What is a String?

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Python supports both single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes for defining strings. Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, they cannot be changed.

```python
single_quote_string = 'Hello, World!'
double_quote_string = "Hello, World!"
